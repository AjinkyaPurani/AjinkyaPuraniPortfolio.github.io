									Retail Sales & Cost Analysis Dashboard <br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>I created a Power BI dashboard to analyze retail sales and costs for nearly 200,000 products and 160,000 customers, totaling over $176M in sales. I cleaned and prepared the data using Power Query and used DAX to calculate key metrics like Cost of Goods Sold, total sales, and inventory. The dashboard includes interactive visuals with drill-downs and filters to explore data by location, category, and time. This helped me identify underperforming categories and expensive SKUs, leading to recommendations that improved profitability and efficiency.</p>

										The Data-Driven Transformation of Fleming Super Store's Supply Chain <br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>Collaborating with Fleming Super Store, I utilized Power BI to tackle financial and customer issues. The result: a 15% boost in revenue, a 20% increase in customer satisfaction, and a significant drop in stockouts from 20 to 5 per month. The success demonstrates the impactful role of data-driven insights in enhancing operational efficiency and business outcomes.</p>

										The Value Chain International Project <br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>Participating in the international value chain exchange learning with Netherlands students was an enlightening experience that provided a deep understanding of the intricacies of global business operations. We had completed three engaging online meetings; I not only had the opportunity to connect with our peers from a different part of the world but also delved into the analysis of an international value chain and its alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>

										Peterborough Furniture Importing Customs Project <br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>I explored all aspects of customs management, from preparing documents to accurately calculating duties and taxes. By improving logistical processes and learning about tariff treatments like MFN and CUSMA, I made sure everything ran smoothly and efficiently. Understanding HS codes helped me save costs and show clear landed costs, which helped in decision-making. This project showed me how crucial Canada Customs is for efficient operations and smooth trade relationships.</p>
